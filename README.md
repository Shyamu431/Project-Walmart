To analyze the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against the customerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions
Also analyse, if the spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men? (Assume 50 million customers are male and 50 million are female).
